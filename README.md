This repository is for Continuous Integration of my simple k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm to pypi package.

#### *k*-Nearest Neighbors
*k*-Nearest Neighbors, kNN for short, is a very simple but powerful technique used for making predictions. The principle behind kNN is to use **“most similar historical examples to the new data.”**

#### *k*-Nearest Neighbors in 4 easy steps
 - Choose a value for *k*
 - Find the distance of the new point to each record of training data
 - Get the k-Nearest Neighbors
 - Making Predictions
   - For classification problem, the new data point belongs to the class that most of the neighbors belong to. 
   - For regression problem, the prediction can be average or weighted average of the label of k-Nearest Neighbors

Finally, we evaluate the model using *k*-Fold Cross Validation technique

#### *k*-Fold Cross Validation
This technique involves randomly dividing the dataset into k-groups or folds of approximately equal size. The first fold is kept for testing and the model is trained on remaining k-1 folds.

## Installation
```
pip install simple-kNN
```
## Usage

```
from simple_kNN.distanceMetrics import distanceMetrics
from simple_kNN.kFoldCV import kFoldCV
from simple_kNN.kNNClassifier import kNNClassifier
```
