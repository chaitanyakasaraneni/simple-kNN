# Simple kNN Package Overview
This package contaians
- distanceMetrics.py
- kNNClassifier.py
- kFoldCV.py

### kNNClassifier.py
Contains the code for kNN classification algorithm.

### distanceMetrics.py
Contains distance metric used to calculate distance between users. (Here there are only 3 metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Hamming)

### kFoldCV.py
Contains code for cross validation evaluation of data

*NOTE: This is just a base code and accuracy might not be higher for every dataset*
